			<h2>For the Love of Baking</h2>
			<p>I fell in love with baking when I was a small kid. I don't exactly remember deciding I liked baking, just that always wanted to walk down the baking aisle of the grocery store and would beg my mom to let me get one of the box cake or muffin recipes!
				<br><br>
				My mom loves to bake as was occasionally willing to let me destroy her kitchen so I could create! My family ate many blueberry muffins and oatmeal chocolate chip cookies by <a href="https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwj498zkk-n1AhUcGK0GHauiAlIYABAFGgJwdg&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESWuD2Yxq7F1jVGfk4Qh-ONH8J0U-O3wKJ-ju7pvLCbkVGVD1cvJxO-xgWb8XiMpFY1NnxGE-2R8Ds0HtcAuLyVeuZ3XeZGAAGkxCGbARIpnP42sw4qGFTIjwa4g&sig=AOD64_2p7UE4QacEmUJHdCMV0PSou9h8JA&ctype=46&q=&ved=2ahUKEwi2wcHkk-n1AhX7CTQIHWViAGAQ9aACegQIARBE&adurl=">Betty Crocker</a> when I was learning.
				<br><br> 
				Before too long, I was ready to try making full recipes by myself. Chocolate Chip and Sugar cookies were staples! 
				<br><br>
				But the momemnt I truly felt like a baker was when I was asked to make one of <em>Mimi's Apple Pies!</em> My grandma, who we call Mimi, has a secret family recipe for Apple Pies and I was 11 years old when I first tried to make it. To this day, it is my favorite thing to make it receives the highest praise from family, friends, and customers!

         <p>I was 12 years old in this picture. My dad hosts a 'Freezer Clean-Out' Party every spring and I was asked to make the pies for my dad and his hunting buddies. The tradition continues to this day.</p>

			<h2>Getting my Start</h2>
			<p>I continued baking throughout high school, making treats for get togethers with friends, family birthday dinners or for special occassions. 
				<br><br>
				One year for Christmas, I was given a KitchenAid Mixer. I cried... <em>literally</em> cried
				<br><br> 
				I couldn't take my baking supplies with me to my college dorm, but once I moved into an apartment during my junior year, the mixer came back and forth to school with me! I made study snacks and holiday treats for my roommates and friends, but it never crossed my mind to <em>charge</em> people for my baking...
				<br><br>
				The day after Thanksgiving in 2015, my mom and a few friends were hosting a Baby Shower! They hadn't considered that most bakeries would be closed on Black Friday, so my mom asked if I would be willing to make the cookies for the party. I literally googled" 'Decorated Sugar Cookies,' found a recipe, and drew out my ideas on a scratch piece of paper.

         </figure>
            The women at the party loved the cookies and few asked me if I took orders. <em>Of course</em> I do... By Christmas of that year, I had business cards and a self-made logo!

			<h2>All About the Cookies</h2>
			<p>Those first few orders were tough! I was overwhelmed by the pressure to create <b>DOZENS</b> of cookies that:
            <ol>
               <li>Tasted great</li>
               <li>Looked the same</li>
               <li>Were delivered on time</li>
               <li>AND... now I had to <b>PRICE</b> them!</li>
            </ol>
				Needless to say, I had a few meltdowns and sleepless nights. Despite the stress, I still loved what I was doing and was getting great reactions and feedback!
				<br><br> 
            I didn't have all of the decorating tools that I have now and have accumulated over the past SIX+ years! (Wow it's been a long time) so I used what I could find and used each order to practice and perfect my skills. 
				<br><br>
				One of the very first lessons I learned? ALWAYS make extra cookies. One will break, or burn, or you'll bump it while the icing is drying... just always make more than you need.

			<h2>It's Not a Party without CAKE!</h2>
			<p>As orders became more regular, I had a few inquiries about <em>non-cookie</em> items... Did I make pies? cakes?   bread? macarons? cupcakes? My answer Every. Single. Time. 
				<br><br>
				"Of course I do!" 
				<br><br>
            There were occasionally some random, very specific orders, but for the most part- moms (my most popular clients)- wanted birthday cakes!

			<h2>One of my Favorite Orders</h2>
			<p>Anything for family is extra special! My niece, Evelyn, was turning <b>four</b> and got to choose what she wanted for the dessert at her party! 
				<br><br>
				I'm guessing most have seen, or at least heard of, the popular unicorn cake... 
				<br><br> 
				It is one thing to know what it is, and a wholly other thing to create it in your kitchen with no practice runs before the party. 
				<br><br>
				In addition to the <em>Funfetti</em> UNICORN cake, she wanted unicorn and rainbow cookies! Why not?!
